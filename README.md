I'm a self-taught FrontEnd developer living in Vancouver. 
There are countless of talented people around the world sharing their creativities and inspirations in webdev and I am really grateful for being able to learn from the community. My passion for webdev lies with turning ideas into elegant interfaces through various languages and tools. I seek to learn continuously to improve thearchitecture and quality of the things I build.
